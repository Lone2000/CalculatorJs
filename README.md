# Calculator Project
This is a simple calculator project implemented using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

#Features
* Basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* Supports input of two numeric arguments and one operator argument.
* User-friendly interface with a responsive design.

# Drawbacks
While this calculator project provides basic functionality for performing arithmetic calculations, it has a few limitations:

* Limited to two numeric arguments: The calculator is designed to work with only two numeric arguments and one operator argument.It does not support complex expressions or multiple operations in a single input.

* Efficiency: The calculator is implemented using vanilla JavaScript, which means it does not utilize any advanced frameworks or libraries. While this approach keeps the codebase lightweight and easy to understand, it may not be as efficient as optimized solutions built with more sophisticated tools.

# Usage
* Open the calculator in your web browser.
* Use the number buttons to input the numeric arguments.
* Click on the operator button to select the desired operation.
* Press the equals button (=) to calculate the result.
* The result will be displayed in the input field.
